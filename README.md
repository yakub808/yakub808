Hello!  
My name is Yakub, I am an architect specializing in space habitat modules.  
Last year I started my journey throughout the world of computer science.  
Currently learning Python and C language, exploring how coding can enhance space design and 3D modeling.  
Any tips and advice much appreciated!
